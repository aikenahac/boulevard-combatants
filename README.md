# Boulevard Combatants

Boulevard Combatants is a Street Fighter 'clone' but bad and without a story.

Made as a school project.

- a browser

1. Install deps

```
pnpm install
```

2. Run it

```
pnpm start
```

3. Open it on the link displayed in the cli (should be [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234))
